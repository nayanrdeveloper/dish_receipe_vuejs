# Cooking Recipes

## Introduction

Cooking Recipes is a web application that provides detailed instructions on how to make a variety of different meals. This project was created using Vue.js, which is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. This was my first project using Vue.js and I chose to use Vue3, Vuex and vue-Router to build it.

Throughout the development process, I learned a lot about Vue3, Vuex and vue-Router, including how to create components, manage state, and handle routing. Overall, this project was a great learning experience and I'm excited to continue building more applications using Vue.js.
